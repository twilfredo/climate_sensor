# Climate Sensor - WIP

## Goals

A small application developed to monitor indoor environmental parameters using the Nordic Thingy52 (nRF52840). Powered by Zephyr RTOS.

The following parameters are currently monitored:
  
  * Temperature - Degrees Celsius
  * Relative Humidity - %
  * Equivalent carbon dioxide reading (eCO2) - ppm
  * Equivalent total volatile organic compound - ppb
  * Battery Voltage/Level

The parameters are displayed on the OLED display connected on the external I2C bus, it supports the SSD1306/SH1106 (with kConfig) display driver IC. The metrics display can be toggled through by the onboard push button (back of board).

## Building/Flashing

App has been tested on latest zephyr release v3.1 (also supports the current development branch as of <88ca3aca98>)

```
git clone git@github.com:thulithwilfred/climate_sensor.git
cd climate_sensor

west build
west flash -r jlink
```

## SSD1306 Driver Patch

You may need to apply the driver patch (in `ssd1306_driver_patch_v3.1`) to the zephyr source for certain `SSD1306/SH1106` driver ICs to work. Check the commit msg on the patch for more details.
